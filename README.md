My personal website!

## Site Facts

### Home Page

This part of the site is where you land when you go to [the site](https://vresod.github.io). Not alot much can be said except for the inclusion of a small Q&A.

### Downloads

Contains my minecraft mods folder, my social media icon, and my minecraft saves folder.

### Games

Contains a few games made by me and eventually a bunch of other people. Credit to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) for the game creation tool.

### Drawings

The newest section! I put random drawings in here along with their title. Most will be clickable, going to their facebook link.
